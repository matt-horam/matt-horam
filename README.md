I've been building web things since just before Google was launched, and using the web for longer still. Every interface I encounter makes me wonder how it could be easier, faster, more intuitive and welcoming.

I design & code, manage integrations, projects & events, handle data & comms, liaise with clients and staff alike.

I love dreaming up solutions that work well for all parties in a transaction, and it doesn’t hurt for them to look great, too.

Outside work, I’ve been planning and running large social events, raising seven kids, and extending our mountain home.

I also play a few instruments, and sing, and sometimes still write songs, as well as designing small tabletop games.
