I've been building web things since just before Google was launched, and using the web for longer still. Every interface I encounter makes me wonder how it could be easier, faster, more intuitive and welcoming.

I design & code, manage integrations, projects & events, handle data & comms, liaise with client and staff alike.

I love dreaming up solutions that work well for all parties in a transaction, and it doesn’t hurt for them to look great, too.

Outside work, I’ve been planning and running large social events, raising seven kids, and extending our mountain home.

I’m hoping to get time to play more music again soon!
